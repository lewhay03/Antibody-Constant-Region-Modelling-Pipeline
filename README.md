# Antibody-Constant-Region-Modelling-Pipeline-Research-Project

This repository contains code and data for building and evaluating structural models of antibody constant regions from different isotypes, combined with the trastuzumab variable region (VH).

## Project Goals
- Generate and compare Fab models with the 9 human isotype CH1 domains in the first instance
- Generate and compare full antibody models with hinge regions modelled and decorated
- Use MODELLER, Clustal Omega, Biopython, and PDB data
- Develop a modular and reproducible modeling pipeline in Python


## Current Status
- VCAb database downloaded
- Isotype Fab template structures selected
- FASTA and PDB templates collected
- Workspace and repo initialized
- Initial script underway
- Directory structure finalised

## Next Steps
- Automate MSA and PIR generation
- Build batch model generation for 9 isotype hybrids
- Add scoring and model evaluation
